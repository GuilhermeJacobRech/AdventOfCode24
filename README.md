# Advent of Code 2024

This project contains my solutions to the coding challenges from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Each day has its own class that inherits from the DayBase class.

Inputs sit in the Inputs folder, separated by name with a leading zero if necessary, e.g:

    Inputs/Day01.txt: The puzzle input specific to day 01.
    Day01.cs: Contains the solution for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the puzzle.
